  <h1>About me</h1>

    Born in 1996, I grew up during the digital rise. As a teenager, I started
    building my first websites and got more and more interested in the digital
    economy.

    After school, I started to study{' '}
    <span class='highlight'>
      Computer Science as a bachelor&apos;s degree</span
    >{' '}
    at Singidunum University and completed many online courses alongside.
